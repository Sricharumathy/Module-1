## Experiment No: 1d â€“ Conditional Statements- Checking Vowel or not

## AIM  
To Write a Python program to check whether the given character is a vowel or not using if..else statement
## ALGORITHM  
1. Begin the program.  
2. Take a character input from the user
3. Convert the character to lowercase
4. Check if the lowercase character is one of the vowels: 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'
5. If it is a vowel, display "The given character is a vowel"
6. Otherwise, display "The given character is NOT a vowel"
4. Terminate the program.

## PROGRAM
```
ch=input()

if(ch=='a' or ch=='A'):
    print("The given character is a vowel")
elif(ch=='e' or ch=='E'):
    print("The given character is a vowel")
elif(ch=='i' or ch=='I'):
    print("The given character is a vowel")
elif(ch=='o' or ch=='O'):
    print("The given character is a vowel")
elif(ch=='u'or ch=='U'):
    print("The given character is a vowel")
else:
    print("The given character is NOT a vowel")
```
